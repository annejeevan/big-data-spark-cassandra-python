# Spark - Cassandra - Python

We will try to install all the required tools to explore and build simple machine learning models using pyspark.

# Installation
* Spark & Cassandra installation (refer [Spark_Cassandra_Ubuntu_Installation.docx](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/blob/master/Spark_Cassandra_Ubuntu_Installation.docx))
* Ipython now Jupyter (For interactive analysis of data in Python, refer [ML_Spark_Python_Ipython.docx](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/blob/master/ML_Spark_Python_Ipython.docx))

# Tasks
* Exploring on how to use pyspark_cassandra external library for getting and analyzing the data in Spark from Cassandra using Python.  Here you will be able to learn on how to export data to Cassandra, retrieve data in Spark using the external library. We can further explore on doing advanced analytics after getting the data to Spark.
  Refer [Pyspark_Cassandra_basic_analysis.docx](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/tree/master/spark-cassandra)
  
 * Exploring the Spark MLLib using Python on HVAC data and Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - UCI Data repository.
It will give an idea on how to build predictive models on Spark using Python. 
Refer to [ML_Spark_Python_Ipython.docx](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/blob/master/ML_Spark_Python_Ipython.docx)) and ipython notebooks [(‘Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - UCI Data repository.ipynb’ and ‘Spark MLLib- Python - HVAC Example.ipynb’)](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/tree/master/ml-spark-python)

* Exploring on how to store and retrieve data in Cassandra using Python. In addition, run ML using Python libraries available on the retrieved data.
Refer to [ApacheCassandra_PythonML.docx & ‘Prediction of House Prices - Cassandra - Python .ipynb’](https://github.com/jeevananne/big-data-spark-cassandra-python/tree/master/cassandra-python)
